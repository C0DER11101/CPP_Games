# Things to put into the game.

1. Timer for mines.
2. Player(whose symbol will be '@').
3. Detector(to detect mines).
4. Digger(to dig the spot where the mine is buried).


**Random depths for the mines, you will have to dig till you reach the mine, if the timer of the mines goes out while you were digging, then the mine will explode and you will die. But if you managed to reach the mine before the timer, then you will need to defuse mine and put into your collection chamber. Hence, the name "MineSweeper".**

**Mines will be buried in random depths and you will have to dig that deep.**

**Each time you play the game, the mines will repositioned in new locations.**
