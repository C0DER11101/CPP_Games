**Okay, I had some trouble downloading the "graphics.h" header file, so I searched for some YouTube videos and came across [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d85OJ7QedUI)**

Also I am going to write down what I did, to install the graphics.h header file apart from following the tutorial!!

This [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/add-graphics-h-c-library-gcc-compiler-linux/) was provided in the above video's description!!
Follow all the commands given in this website(because these are the commands that are used in that video!!

Also an error will pop up when you will run the following command:

`sudo apt-get install libesd0-dev libdirectfb-dev libdirectfb-extra libfreetype6-dev`

The error will be `E:unable to locate package libesd0-dev`.

This link will solve the above problem:
